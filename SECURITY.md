# Security Considerations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notices

### üîí This is a Proof of Concept
- **DO NOT** use this code in production without a thorough security audit
- This project is for educational and demonstration purposes only
- The smart contracts have not been audited by professional security firms

### üîê Private Key Management

**NEVER commit private keys to version control!**

The following files are automatically excluded by `.gitignore`:
- `services/.env`
- `services/.env.*`
- All `.env*` files

### üß™ Test Networks Only

The deployed contracts and wallets shown in this README are on **Base Sepolia testnet**:
- Escrow Contract: `0x60c3CA86175692d452D7e3A488Ef39Ca7aa65b9a`
- These addresses contain only testnet tokens with no real value
- The private keys used are for demonstration only and should NEVER be used on mainnet

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Development

1. **Use `.env.example` as template**
   ```bash
   cp services/.env.example services/.env
   # Edit services/.env with your own private keys
   ```

2. **Generate fresh wallets**
   ```bash
   cast wallet new  # Generate new wallet addresses
   ```

3. **Never reuse testnet keys**
   - Always generate new keys for each deployment
   - Testnet keys can be compromised and should not be used on mainnet

### For Production (If You Proceed)

1. **Smart Contract Audit**
   - Get a professional security audit from firms like:
     - Trail of Bits
     - OpenZeppelin
     - Consensys Diligence

2. **Key Management**
   - Use hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor)
   - Implement multi-sig for contract ownership
   - Use secure key management systems (AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault)

3. **Access Control**
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Use time-locks for sensitive operations
   - Add emergency pause mechanisms

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set up real-time monitoring for bond levels
   - Alert systems for unusual activity
   - Track refund claims and patterns

## üîç Known Limitations

### Smart Contract Risks

1. **Bond Depletion**: If the bond is fully depleted, clients cannot receive refunds
2. **Signature Replay**: Server must track used request commitments
3. **Gas Costs**: Clients pay gas fees to claim refunds (~81k gas on Base Sepolia)

### System Design Risks

1. **Centralized Facilitator**: The x402 protocol uses `https://x402.org/facilitator`
2. **Server Trust**: Server must sign refund authorizations honestly
3. **EIP-712 Security**: Depends on proper domain separator configuration

## üö® Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Email the repository owner privately
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
